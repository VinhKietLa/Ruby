  # Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.

  # Add an accessor method to your MyCar class to change and view the color of your car. Then add an accessor method that allows you to view, but not modify, the year of your car.
